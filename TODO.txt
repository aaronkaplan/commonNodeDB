* make the whole DB multi-tenant capable (i.e. have multiple small wireless community networks in the same country use the same DB setup)

* needed info for freq planning: 
   - location (lat/lon/height),
   - who is master, who is slave? (in case of PtP or PtMP links)
   - gain (dB)
   - horizontal/vertical 
   - txpower 
   - direction (azimuth/inclination), 
   - average noise level

* make the zone/network concept clearer in the DB

* remove logrecords tables. Not needed. This should stay in RRD or similar. It would be overkill to have it here.
